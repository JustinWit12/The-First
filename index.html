I am a super hero, I can't tell you my name because that would blow my cover.<br> I am here to save the world, I am a shape shifter, I can take any form that I wish.<br> I was involved in a serious accident that led to me being able to shapeshift.<br> I was infected with a rare type of radiation that allowed me to alter my molecular make-up.<br> To learn more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome">click here.</a> I plan to use this power to save the world from any thing that threatens us.<br>
